# Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) General Matrix Multiplication (gemm) Tests

## Introduction

This project will explore the advantages of using SIMD intrinsincs to optimize matrix multiplication, a common operation in most fields of computing.

## Design Choices

* No templating is done because templating is slow.
