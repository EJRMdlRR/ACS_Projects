# Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) General Matrix Multiplication (gemm) Tests

## Introduction

This project will explore the advantages of using SIMD intrinsincs to optimize matrix multiplication, a common operation in most fields of computing.

## Design Choices

* No templating is done because templating is slow. (Testing needs to be done to dertermine if diff is negligible.)
* By saving matrices as 1D matrices of size length x width entire matrix is contiguous. Makes memory access slightly faster as there are no lookups.
* Since matrices are of known size, allocate memory ahead of time. Removes penalty of changing vector size mid-matrix creation.
* The transpose is generated at the same time as the matrix. This wastes twice as much memory, but prevents O(length*width) operations each time a transpose for a multiplication is needed. Thus the more frequently a matrix is used as the second operand the lower the cost of that memory. (future implementations might leverage caching instead.)
